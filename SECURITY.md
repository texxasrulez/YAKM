# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We generally support the latest minor release line. Older versions may receive fixes on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately:
- Open a **private advisory** on GitHub (Security → Advisories), or
- Email the maintainers listed in the repository profile.

Do not file public issues for vulnerabilities. We will coordinate a fix and release, and credit you unless you request anonymity.
