TEMPLATES: Seed + Theme Preview
- The Templates page now seeds three example templates (auto_reply_ack, notify_webmaster_basic, notify_webmaster_rich) if the table is empty.
- Each echoes user data using {{placeholders}} like {{name}}, {{email}}, {{subject}}, {{message_html}}.
- Preview renders the template INSIDE your currently selected email theme.

MESSAGES: Search / CSV
- At the top of Messages you can filter by text, email, IP, and date range (if your table has created_at).
- "Export CSV" downloads the filtered results.
- CSV export guards against formula injection.

SECURITY: Rate Limits + Alerts
- Configure in Admin → Security:
  * Enable
  * Window (minutes)
  * Max submissions per IP
  * Email webmaster on violation
- Enforcement hook is provided in /kontact/lib/security_runtime.php.

INTEGRATION (one-time) — Hook rate limit into send_mail.php
1) Open: /kontact/send_mail.php
2) After the line that includes bootstrap, add these two lines:
   require_once __DIR__ . '/lib/security_runtime.php';
   if (!\Kontact\enforce_rate_limit_or_abort($_SERVER)) { exit; }

   Example patch location (search for this line):
     require_once __DIR__ . '/lib/bootstrap.php';
   Insert the two lines immediately after it.

3) Done. Every submission logs an audit "form_submit". When over the threshold, it logs "rate_limit_block" and returns HTTP 429 (and optionally emails the webmaster).

NOTES
- All new tables created with CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS.
- No inline <style> tags added to admin pages; theme rendering for emails remains in the theme files.
