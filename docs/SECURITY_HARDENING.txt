SECURITY HARDENING — PASTE AS PLAIN TEXT

• Auth: session-based; passwords hashed with Argon2id (or bcrypt fallback).
• CSRF: hidden token on all admin forms.
• Blocklist: requests from blocked IPs are diverted to /spammer.html when `Security::isBlocked()` is used.
• Rate limiting: record failures in `kontact_audit` and enforce thresholds (e.g., >5 fails in 10min triggers alert).
• reCAPTCHA: server verify only when both secret and response present (no warnings while testing).
• No inline CSS: all admin styles in `/kontact/assets/css/`.
• Drop-in safe: no absolute paths outside the project folder.

Recommended extras:
• Enable SMTP delivery with authenticated sender (improves DMARC/DKIM alignment).
• Add a plaintext part alongside HTML for best deliverability.
• Add a honeypot + min-submit-time check and record the event to the audit table.
