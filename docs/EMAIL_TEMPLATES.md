# Email Templates (DB)

- Each template has `name`, `subject`, and `body_html` (HTML fragment).
- Use placeholders as needed (e.g., your body can rely on `$message_html` produced by the form).
- Preview shows the template wrapped by the current email theme.
- Auto‑reply template can be selected and enabled in Settings.
