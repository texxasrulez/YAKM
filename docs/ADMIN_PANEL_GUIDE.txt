ADMIN PANEL GUIDE — PASTE AS PLAIN TEXT

Access: /kontact/admin/

1) Users
   - Create additional admin accounts.
   - Passwords are hashed using Argon2id if available, else bcrypt.

2) Settings
   Site
     • Site Name — used in email headers/templates.
     • Site URL — used for links in emails.
     • Site Logo Path — path starting with `/` to an image accessible by recipients.
     • Form Title — small label like "Visitor".
     • Form Name — like "Contact".

   Email
     • Webmaster Email — default recipient if nothing else matches.
     • Additional Emails — optional comma-separated list (informational).
     • Email Theme — picks a file from `/kontact/themes/*_theme.php` used to render outgoing HTML email.

   Recipients
     • Recipient Mode — Single or Multiple.
     • Recipients (JSON) — only used in Multiple mode; the JS fills your `<select name="recipient">` from this JSON.
       Example:
       [
         {"label":"Webmaster","email":"admin@domain.com"},
         {"label":"Alto","email":"alto@domain.com"}
       ]

   reCAPTCHA
     • Site Key / Secret Key — turn on verification. Leave blank while testing.

   Suspicious Activity
     • Toggle to email webmaster when thresholds are exceeded (when wired).

3) Templates
   - Create & edit named templates (DB-stored), independent of PHP themes.
   - Use “Import samples” (shown only when there are zero templates) to seed example templates:
       • contact_notification — sent to Webmaster
       • auto_reply_ack — example auto-reply

4) Security
   - Blocklist: add/remove IPs. When `Security::isBlocked()` is used in mail flow, blocked IPs are redirected to `/spammer.html`.
   - Audit log: failures can be recorded to support rate-limiting thresholds.
