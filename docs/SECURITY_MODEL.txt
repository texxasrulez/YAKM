SECURITY MODEL — PASTE AS PLAIN TEXT
- Session login; Argon2id if available; BCRYPT fallback.
- CSRF tokens on all admin forms.
- Blocklist enforced via Security::isBlocked() (add include to send_mail.php).
- Audit table for failures; can add rate-limiting easily.
- No absolute paths; everything relative under /kontact.
- Setup self-deletes after success, per your explicit exception.
