RECIPIENT DROPDOWN JS — PASTE AS PLAIN TEXT

Goal: auto-populate <select name="recipient"> from admin-configured JSON.

Include in your page <head>:
  <script src="kontact/assets/js/multiple_recipients.js"></script>

In the form:
  <select name="recipient" id="recipient" required></select>

How it works:
  - The script locates itself and infers the base path (works for custom folder names).
  - It fetches `api/recipients.php` and inserts options with email as the value.

Optional placeholder:
  <select name="recipient" id="recipient" required>
    <option value="">— Select a recipient —</option>
  </select>
