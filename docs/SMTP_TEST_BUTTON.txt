SMTP TEST BUTTON — PASTE AS PLAIN TEXT

A "Send SMTP Test" button is now available in Admin → Settings (SMTP section).
It sends a multipart test message to the Webmaster using the current SMTP settings.
- If SMTP is disabled or fails, it uses the mail() fallback.
- The result page confirms success/failure and shows the target address and SMTP host:port used.
